# Coin-flip-
The point of this web development is to test the statistical significance of flipping a coin and to demonstrate the statistical probability of coin flips in general. When increasing the amount of coin flips with an equal probability of landing on heads or tails we see that the results move closer to the mean and outliers have less of an effect on the data. The point of this excercise was not only to develop a working web application but also demonstrate a keen understanding of statistics and probability as well. NOTE: the majority of coding was done on the master branch of this repository and uploaded to render from there.
